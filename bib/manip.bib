This paper studies the structure of dual-arm rearrangement for synchronous, monotone tabletop setups and develops an optimal MILP model. It then describes an efficient and scalable algorithm, which first minimizes the cost of object transfers and then of transitions between objects. This is motivated by the fact that asymptotically object transfers dominate the cost of solutions. Moreover, a lazy strategy minimizes the number of motion planning calls and results in significant speedups. Theoretical arguments support the benefits of using two arms and indicate that synchronous operation introduces only a small cost increase. Experiments support these points and show that the scalable method can quickly compute solutions close to optimal for the considered setup.},

journal="Autonomous Robots",

abstract="Many exciting robotic applications require multiple robots with many degrees of freedom, such as manipulators, to coordinate their motion in a shared workspace. Discovering high-quality paths in such scenarios can be achieved, in principle, by exploring the composite space of all robots. Sampling-based planners do so by building a roadmap or a tree data structure in the corresponding configuration space and can achieve asymptotic optimality. The hardness of motion planning, however, renders the explicit construction of such structures in the composite space of multiple robots impractical. This work proposes a scalable solution for such coupled multi-robot problems, which provides desirable path-quality guarantees and is also computationally efficient. In particular, the proposed {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathtt{\{}dRRT^*{\}}{\$}{\$}dRRT∗is an informed, asymptotically-optimal extension of a prior sampling-based multi-robot motion planner, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathtt{\{}dRRT{\}}{\$}{\$}dRRT. The prior approach introduced the idea of building roadmaps for each robot and implicitly searching the tensor product of these structures in the composite space. This work identifies the conditions for convergence to optimal paths in multi-robot problems, which the prior method was not achieving. Building on this analysis, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathtt{\{}dRRT{\}}{\$}{\$}dRRTis first properly adapted so as to achieve the theoretical guarantees and then further extended so as to make use of effective heuristics when searching the composite space of all robots. The case where the various robots share some degrees of freedom is also studied. Evaluation in simulation indicates that the new algorithm, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathtt{\{}dRRT^*{\}}{\$}{\$}dRRT∗  converges to high-quality paths quickly and scales to a higher number of robots where various alternatives fail. This work also demonstrates the planner's capability to solve problems involving multiple real-world robotic arms.",
