Following from Lemma \ref{lem:transferdomination}, the current analysis studies the dual arm costs in the randomized unit tabletop setting, with $c_t$ as the cost measure per unit distance. 
For the $2$-arm setting, assume for simplicity that each arm's volume is represented as a disc of some radius 
$r$. For obtaining a $2$-arm solution, we partition the $n$ objects randomly 
into two piles of $\frac{n}{2}$ objects each; then obtain two initial solutions 
similar to the single arm case. It is expected (Eq.~\ref{eq:single-cost-simple}) that these two halves 
should add up to approximately $(c_{pd} + 0.52c_t)n$. 


\begin{theorem}
	\textit{For rearranging objects with non-overlapping starts and goals that are
	uniformly distributed in a unit square,  a $2$-arm solution can have an 
	asymptotic improvement of $\frac{1}{2}$ over the single arm solution. }
	\label{thm:karm}
\end{theorem}

\textit{Proof: }
From the initial $2$-arm solution, we construct an {\em asynchronous} $2$-arm 
solution that is collision-free. Assume that pickups 
and drop-offs can be achieved without collisions between the two arms, which 
can be achieved with properly designed end-effectors. The main overhead 
is then the potential collision between the two (disc) arms during transfer 
and move operations. Because there are $\frac{n}{2}$ objects for each arm to work 
with, an arm may travel a path formed by $n + 1$ straight line 
segments. Therefore, there are up to $(n + 1)^2$ intersections between the 
two end-effector trajectories where potential collision may happen. However,
because for the transfers and transits associated with one pair of objects (one 
for each arm) can have at most four intersections, there are at most 
$2n$ potential collisions to handle. For each intersection, let one 
arm wait while letting the other circling around it, which incurs a cost that is bounded by $2\pi \cdot
r \cdot c_t$. 


Adding up all the potential extra cost,  
% that a $2$-arm solution has 
a cumulative cost is obtained as 
% \begin{align}\label{eq:dual-cost-distance} 
% C_{dual} = C_{single} + 2n(2\pi rc_t) \approx (c_{pd} + 0.52c_t + 4\pi rc_t)n.
% \end{align}

{\centerline
{
$C_{\rm dual} = C_{\rm single} + 2n(2\pi rc_t) \approx (c_{pd} + 0.52c_t + 4\pi rc_t)n\;.$
}
}

\noindent For small $r$, $C_{\rm dual}$ is almost the same as $C_{\rm single}$ 
$c_t$ is a distance (e.g., energy) cost. Upon considering the maximum of the two arc lengths or makespan (Eq.~\ref{eq:cost_function}),
the $2$-arm cost becomes $C_{\rm dual}^t \approx (c_{pd} + 0.52c_t)\frac{n}{2} + 4n\pi rc_t$.

\begin{theorem}
	\textit{For rearranging objects with non-overlapping starts and goals that are

	asymptotic improvement of $\frac{1}{2}$ over the single arm solution if $\frac{c_t}{c_{pd}}$ is small, and a improvement $\approx 0.64$ when both $c_{pd}$ and $r$ are small. }
\end{theorem}


\textit{Proof:} The synchronization assumption changes the expected cost of the solution. The random partitioning of the $n$ objects into two sets of $\frac{n}{2}$ object with a random ordering of the objects yields $\frac{n}{2}$ pairs of objects transfers, which dominate the total cost for large $n$. The cost~(Eq.~\ref{eq:cost_function}) of $\frac{n}{2}$ synchronized transfers ($\coma_i$) includes $\frac{n}{2}c_{pd}$ and $C^{\rm sync}_{sg} \approx (\mathtt{E}(max(l_1,l_2))c_t)\frac{n}{2}$, where $\mathtt{E}(max(l_1,l_2))$ is the expected measure of the max of lengths $l_1$,$l_2$ of two randomly paired transfers. Using the \textit{pdf}\cite{ghosh1951random} of lengths of random lines in an unit square and integrating over the setup\cite{Shome2018WAFR}, results in the value of $\mathtt{E}(max(l_1,l_2))$ to be $0.66$ . 
% (Section \ref{sec:appendix}). 



\tase{
\begin{lemma}
	Expected measure of the maximum of lengths of two random lines on an unit square is $ 0.66 $.
\end{lemma}

\textit{Proof:} Prior work \cite{ghosh1951random} defines the \textit{probability distribution function (pdf)} of lengths($l$) of randomly sampled lines in a rectangle.
% of sides $a,b, \ \ a\geq b$.
% as 
%\begin{align*}
%p(l) &= (\frac{4l}{a^2b^2})\phi(l)\\
%\phi(l)&= \frac{1}{2}\pi a b - a l - b l + \frac{1}{2} l^2, \ \ l\in[0,b]\\
%\phi(l)&= ab \sininv(\frac{b}{l}) + a. \sqrt[]{(l^2-b^2)} - al - \frac{1}{2}b^2, \ \ l\in[b,a]\\
%\phi(l)&= ab\{\sininv(\frac{b}{l})-\cosinv(\frac{a}{l})\} + a\sqrt[]{(l^2-b^2)} + b\sqrt[]{(l^2-a^2)} \\
%&- \frac{1}{2}(l^2+a^2+b^2),\ \ l\in[a,\sqrt[]{(a^2+b^2)}]
%\end{align*}

%In the unit square model, $a=b=1$. Substituting the values, the \textit{pdf} becomes
In the unit square model, substituting the values for the dimensions of the sides of the rectangle with $1$, the \textit{pdf} can be simplified as follows.
\begin{align*}
p(l)&= 2\pi l - 8\pi l^2 + 2l^3, \ \ l\in[0,1]\\
p(l)&= 4l\sininv(\frac{1}{l}) - 4l\cosinv(\frac{1}{l}) + 8l\sqrt[]{(l^2-1)} -2l^3 -4l,\\ &\ l\in[1,\sqrt[]{2}]
\end{align*}

Assuming two random sets of lines, representing transfers in a random split of objects between two arms, we need the expected value of the maximum of these pairwise lengths ie., $\mathtt{E}(max(l_1,l_2)), \ \ l_1,l_2\ i.i.d, \ \ l_1 \sim p, l_2 \sim p$.
This is estimated using the \textit{pdf} obtained. 
\begin{align*}
\mathtt{E}(max(l_1,l_2)) &= \int_0^{\sqrt[]{2}} \int_0^{\sqrt[]{2}} max(l_1,l_2)p(l_1)p(l_2) dl_2 dl_1\\&\approx 0.663
\end{align*}
The result is calculated by taking into account the combination of different ranges of $p(l)$ and $max(l_1,l_2)$.

	Prior work~\cite{santalo2004integral} offered an estimate for the expected length of a transit path $C_{sg}$ in terms of the expected length of a line segment, $0.52$, in a randomized setting in an unit square. With the current estimate of $0.663$ for the maximum of two such randomly sampled line segments, it follows that, the expected makespan or maximum of distances cost will use this estimate.\qed
	
%	Using this result, the synchronized cost ratio is stated in Equation~\ref{eq:synchronized-ratio} as
%	$$
%	\frac{C_{\rm dual}^{\rm sync}}{C_{\rm single}} \approx 
%	\frac{(c_{pd} + 0.66c_t)\frac{n}{2} + 4n\pi rc_t}{(c_{pd} + 0.52c_t)n}
%	$$
%	As a way to validate our asymptotic estimate, randomized trials were run with different number randomly sampled object transfer coordinates on an unit square.

When $\frac{c_t}{c_{pd}}$ is small, even the synchronized $2$-arm solution provides an improvement of $\frac{1}{2}$. For the case when both $r$ and $c_{pd}$ are small, we observe that the ratio approaches $0.636$. 
\commentdel{Fig \ref{fig:bounds} confirms empirically that in randomized trials on an unit square, the ratio of $\frac{C_{dual}^{sync}}{C_{single}}$ when $c_{pd}=0,r=0$, converges to the calculated estimate (red line).}
